### Multimodal Large Model Joint Learning Algorithm: Reproduction Based on KubeEdge-Ianvs

---

**Motivation**  
KubeEdge-Ianvs currently focuses on edge-cloud collaborative learning (training and inference) for a single modality of data. However, edge devices, such as those in autonomous vehicles, often capture multimodal data, including GPS, LIDAR, and Camera data. Single-modal learning can no longer meet the precise inference requirements of edge devices. Therefore, this project aims to integrate mainstream multimodal large model joint learning algorithms into KubeEdge-Ianvs edge-cloud collaborative learning, providing multimodal learning capabilities.

---

**Goals**  
1. **Modify and adapt the existing edge-cloud data collection interface** to meet the requirements of multimodal data collection.
2. **Implement a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) benchmark suite** based on Ianvs.
3. **Reproduce mainstream multimodal joint learning (training and inference) algorithms** and integrate them into Ianvs single-task learning.
4. **(Advanced)** Test the effectiveness of multimodal joint learning in at least one of Ianvs' advanced paradigms (lifelong learning, incremental learning, federated learning, etc.).

---

**Proposal**  
1. **Enhance the Edge-Cloud Data Collection Interface:**  
   Modify and adapt the existing edge-cloud data collection interface to support the requirements for multimodal data collection, ensuring compatibility with diverse data sources.
   
2. **Develop a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) Benchmark Suite:**  
   Implement a benchmark suite specifically for Multimodal Large Language Models based on the Ianvs framework, facilitating robust evaluation and comparison of model performance.

3. **Reproduce and Integrate Mainstream Multimodal Joint Learning Algorithms:**  
   Reproduce widely recognized multimodal joint learning algorithms for both training and inference, integrating them into the single-task learning capabilities of Ianvs to enhance its versatility.

---

**Design Details**  

**Overall Architecture**  
1. **Dataset:**  
   Enhance this component by incorporating support for multimodal data types, including text, audio, and Camera data. This will enable the system to efficiently manage and preprocess diverse data streams necessary for effective multimodal learning.
   
2. **ModelEvaluationController:**  
   Extend this component to include benchmarks specifically for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Implement evaluation metrics such as F1 Score, Precision, Recall, and Transfer Ratio, tailored for assessing the performance of multimodal models in edge-cloud scenarios.

 **Multimodal Learning: Demonstrated Improvements in Inference Accuracy Over Single-Modal Data**

- Image-based classification can effectively distinguish between broad document categories (e.g., passports vs. banking documents). However, it 
  struggles with documents that share similar layouts or templates, where fine distinctions often depend on the text content. This limitation 
  highlights the necessity for multimodal learning, which combines both visual and textual data for more accurate classification.**Change of 
  Ianvs**  

- The introduction of this multimodal network improves classification **accuracy by 3% on two specific datasets (Tobacco3482 and RVL-CDIP)** 
  when compared to models that rely on only visual features. This improvement occurs even when the text extracted by OCR is not completely 
  clean, proving the robustness of the multimodal approach.

1. **Dataset Handling**  
   The `Dataset` class has been updated to handle multiple types of data such as text, images, and audio.

   **Adding New Enums in `DatasetFormat`:**
   ```python
   class DatasetFormat(Enum):
       TXT = "txt"
       CSV = "csv"
       JSON = "json"
       IMAGE = "image"
       AUDIO = "audio"
   ```

   **Updating `_check_dataset_url` Method:**
   ```python
   @classmethod
   def _check_dataset_url(cls, url):
       if not utils.is_local_file(url) and not os.path.isabs(url):
           raise ValueError(f"dataset file({url}) is not a local file and not a absolute path.")
       
       file_format = utils.get_file_format(url)
       if file_format not in [v.value for v in DatasetFormat.__members__.values()]:
           raise ValueError(f"dataset file({url})'s format({file_format}) is not supported.")
   ```

   **Implementing `ImageDataParse` Class:**
   ```python
   class ImageDataParse:
       def __init__(self, data_type, func=None):
           self.data_type = data_type
           self.func = func

       def parse(self, file, label=None):
           # Implement image parsing logic here
           pass
   ```

   **Implementing `AudioDataParse` Class:**
   ```python
   class AudioDataParse:
       def __init__(self, data_type, func=None):
           self.data_type = data_type
           self.func = func

       def parse(self, file, label=None):
           # Implement audio parsing logic here
           pass
   ```

   **Updating `process_dataset` Method:**
   ```python
   def process_dataset(self):
       self.train_url = self._process_index_file(self.train_url)
       self.test_url = self._process_index_file(self.test_url)
       # Add any additional processing for image and audio datasets if necessary
   ```

   **Updating `split_dataset` Method:**
   ```python
   def split_dataset(self, dataset_url, dataset_format, ratio, method="default",
                     dataset_types=None, output_dir=None, times=1):
       if method == "default":
           return self._splitting_more_times(dataset_url, dataset_format, ratio,
                                             data_types=dataset_types,
                                             output_dir=output_dir,
                                             times=times)
       # Add new splitting methods for image and audio datasets if necessary
       raise ValueError(f"dataset splitting method({method}) is not supported,"
                        f"currently, method supports 'default'.")
   ```

2. **Test Environment Configuration**  
   The `TestEnv` class has been updated to support configurations for multimodal datasets and specific metrics for large language models.

   ```python
   class TestEnv:
       def __init__(self, config):
           # Initializing model evaluation parameters
           self.model_eval = {
               "model_metric": {
                   "mode": "",
                   "name": "",
                   "url": "",
               },
               "threshold": 0.9,  # Threshold for evaluation
               "operator": ">"    # Operator to compare metrics against the threshold
           }
           self.metrics = []                # List to store evaluation metrics
           self.incremental_rounds = 2      # Number of incremental rounds (minimum 2)
           self.datasets = []                # List of datasets for testing
           self.modalities = []              # List of modalities for multimodal support
           self._parse_config(config)        # Parse the configuration provided

       def _check_fields(self):
           # Check if required fields are populated
           if not self.metrics:
               raise ValueError(f"Metrics not found: {self.metrics}.")
           if not isinstance(self.incremental_rounds, int) or self.incremental_rounds < 2:
               raise ValueError(f"Incremental rounds (value={self.incremental_rounds}) "
                                "must be an integer and not less than 2.")

       def _parse_config(self, config):
           # Parse the configuration dictionary for TestEnv settings
           config_dict = config[str.lower(TestEnv.__name__)]
           for k, v in config_dict.items():
               if k == str.lower(Dataset.__name__):
                   self.datasets.append(Dataset(v))  # Initialize datasets
               elif k == "modalities":
                   self.modalities = v  # Set modalities
               else:
                   if k in self.__dict__:
                       self.__dict__[k] = v  # Update attributes dynamically

           self._check_fields()  # Validate the parsed configuration

       def prepare(self):
           # Prepare datasets for testing
           try:
               for dataset in self.datasets:
                   dataset.process_datasets()  # Process each dataset
           except Exception as err:
               raise RuntimeError(f"Dataset preparation failed, error: {err}.") from err
   ```
